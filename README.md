Check pokemons stats. [Available through Xposed repository](http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.icecream.snorlax)
  
This module acts as a [man in the middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) on Pokémon Go's communications with the server, and allows us to add extra features to the game.

### Features:
- Prevent PokemonGo from detecting GPS is being spoofed (similar to Mock Mock Locations)
- Replace pokemons name with custom formats ([details](https://github.com/igoticecream/Snorlax/wiki/Custom-formats)) :
  - Nickname
  - Level
  - Type
  - Moves (name, type, power)
  - IV (%, attack, defence, stamina)
  - HP (current, max)
  - CP (current, evolution)
